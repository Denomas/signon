Hello <%= @user.name %>,

We have noticed that you have not used your GOV.UK applications for some time. GOV.UK application accounts are suspended after <%= User::SUSPENSION_THRESHOLD_PERIOD.inspect %> of inactivity.

Your account will be suspended <%= suspension_time %>.

If you do not sign-in to your account, it will be suspended and you will no longer be able to access these applications.

All you need to do in order to prevent the suspension is sign-in:

<%= new_user_session_url(protocol: 'https') %>

If you are unable to sign-in to your account because you've forgotten your login details, you can reset your password:

<%= new_user_password_url(protocol: 'https') %>
