Hello <%= @user.name %>,

GOV.UK Signon accounts are suspended after <%= User::SUSPENSION_THRESHOLD_PERIOD.inspect %> of inactivity.

Your <%= account_name %> will be suspended <%= suspension_time %> and you won’t be able to access any GOV.UK applications.

Sign in to your account to stop it being suspended:

<%= new_user_session_url(protocol: 'https') %>

If you’ve forgotten your passphrase, you can ask for a new one on the sign in screen.
